String pool:  a special memory region where String objects are stored, when creating a string literal,
java checks if that string already exists in the pool, if it does,
it simply returns the reference to the existing string object, if not, a new string object is created and added to the pool.
 String name = "Hamza"; --> added to the pool
 String name = new String("Hamza") --> do not add to the pool, direct to the heap.
